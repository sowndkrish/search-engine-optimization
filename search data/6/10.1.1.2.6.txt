Abstract: The efficient use of network capacity in shared restoration schemes strongly depends upon the path selection
procedure. In this paper we propose and evaluate efficient shared path selection algorithms for restoration of
connections in optical networks. Namely, two distributed path selection algorithms are proposed. The first approach
maintains global information on network resource usage to determine link sharability and compute optimal shared
paths. The second approach only relies upon local information maintained at each node. Subsequently, we present an
analytical model to evaluate the performance of these path selection algorithms and show its accuracy through
numerical examples. Results indicate that path selection algorithms that maximally exploit the use of reserved sharable
channels do not necessarily result in fast restoration; rather these two optimality criteria can conflict most of the time.
Additionally, algorithms that maximally exploit the sharability condition typically result in lower scalability and higher
complexity.
I- Introduction:
Recently, wavelength Division Multiplexed (WDM) mesh networks have received much attention and
emerged as a very promising transport solution for next-generation data networks. Given the scale of
these architectures, where each fiber can potentially carry terabits of data, service survivability [1,2]
becomes a critical requirement for network planning and management. Service survivability stipulates
that upon the failure of any network element, all affected connections be rerouted within a short time
interval using spare capacity reserved on alternate paths. Alternatively, if spare capacity is not reserved
a-priori, the network must dynamically search/compute alternate routes and reserve resources to restore
affected connections. However, since this latter approach exhibits longer restoration times and cannot
guarantee complete service recovery, it may not be very feasible. Hence, the work herein only considers
the case where spare capacity is already reserved during connection setup, referred to hereafter as path
protection.
A variety of optical path protection schemes have been proposed using concepts such as disjoint
dedicated paths (1+1, 1:1), or shared backup paths [3]. In 1+1 protection, traffic is transmitted
simultaneously on both working and protection paths, and in case of failure, the destination is required
1
to switch between working and protection paths, i.e., non-signaled switchover. Although such recovery
is very fast, it is very inefficient due to the inherent resource redundancy. Meanwhile in 1:1 path
protection, both working and protection paths are provisioned simultaneously, but data is only rerouted
to the working path. As a result, protection paths can be used to transmit low priority pre-emptable
traffic during non-failure conditions. As in 1+1 protection, recovery here is relatively fast, but efficiency
is somewhat improved. Shared path protection builds upon this concept by further increasing resource
efficiency. Here, backup resources can be shared amongst many lightpaths if they fail independently.
Now since resources along the protection path are shared, switch nodes along the protection path are not
configured at connection setup. Instead, upon a failure, source nodes (of failed paths) are notified and
generate signaling messages to configure the switches along the protection path. In this paper we focus
on shared path protection as it yields fast restoration/high efficiency for mesh WDM networks.
A key issue pertaining to shared mesh protection addressed herein is the online path selection algorithm
[2, 20]. First, we propose two distributed path selection algorithms to compute primary and backup
paths. The first approach relies upon global knowledge of network resource utilization at each node to
determine link sharability and compute optimum path pairs. It is assumed that such global information
is disseminated throughout the network via extensions to existing routing protocols, such as OSFP and
IS-IS [4,5]. Hence the source node computes a set of K primary shortest paths along with an optimum
link disjoint backup path for each (which does not necessarily have to be the shortest link disjoint path).
From this set, the path pair with the least cost is selected. Conversely, and to reduce the burden of
network resource update, each node in the second approach only maintains local information and
resource availability/sharability is determined in a distributed manner. Here all primary and secondary
path pairs are selected from a set of pre-computed routes. Not surprisingly, these two path selection
algorithms achieve different, often conflicting, objectives. Namely, while the former achieves better
network resource utilization, the latter restricts the average hop count on the backup paths and yields
faster service restoration times.
Subsequently, we derive an analytical model to evaluate the performance of the proposed path selection
schemes. Although extensive work has been done on WDM performance evaluation [7-13], to our
knowledge these studies have not considered extensions for shared backup paths. Our model simplifies
the analysis of WDM networks by using the multi-layer graph representation [19], where each layer
corresponds to a virtual graph on a specific wavelength. Hence the routing and wavelength assignment
(RWA) [10] problem is reduced to routing in circuit-switched networks [16], a well-studied problem for
which it is relatively easy to approximate network blocking.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Different distributed path selection algorithms are
presented in section II and their respective complexities and scalabilities compared. Subsequently,
2
previous analytical work on WDM network performance evaluation is reviewed in Section III and a new
analytical model for shared path protection proposed. Section IV compares the accuracy of the derived
analytical models against detailed simulation results and also compares the different path selection
schemes. Final conclusions are presented in Section V.
II- Distributed shared path selection
2.1- Background and Motivation:
We consider the problem of online provisioning of mesh-restored optical connections, where distributed
path selection is used to compute optimal pairs of primary and backup paths. In this scenario, where a
source node has to make a routing decision without the knowledge of future requests, a common routing
objective is to select potential diverse paths (primary and backup) while allocating the minimum number
of resources, i.e., maximize the use of reserved sharable channels. Another objective is also to select
backup paths that provide fast recovery for the affected connections in case of link failure. Now since
resources on shared backup paths are only configured after failure occurrences, this requires the
selection of shorter backup paths to ensure rapid service recovery. However, these two optimality
criteria typically conflict most of the time, i.e., to maximally exploit the gain of wavelength sharability,
one needs to allow longer backup paths, however shorter paths are required for fast service restorability.
Also note that these sophisticated path selection algorithms require detailed knowledge of network state,
as derived from extensions to existing link state routing protocols [4,5].
Recent work on service survivability has focused on implementing capacity design algorithms for fast
connection recovery in WDM networks. For example, in [1], the authors formulate the problem as a
generalization of the maximum concurrent flow problem. Resources on backup paths are pre-configured
to ensure fast service recovery, however restrictions on backup path sharing are imposed. On the other
hand, the authors of [14] present a stochastic approach to compute shared mesh restorable connections
to improve network scalability. Here, less information is deemed sufficient to determine the sharability
of channels with remarkable accuracy. Meanwhile, a distributed path selection algorithm for a GMPLS-
based shared mesh restoration scheme is presented in [2]. Here, a Full Information Restoration (FIR)
algorithm is proposed, using signaling protocol extensions to distribute and collect additional link state
information without relying upon centralized setups. On the other hand, [15] addresses the problem of
efficient shared path protection under distributed control with only partial information knowledge.
2.2- Path Selection Algorithms:
2.2.1- Distributed Path selection with Global Information (DPGI):
3
As mentioned previously, the first approach is based upon global network state knowledge at each node.
Here, upon arrival of a connection request, the source node computes a set of K shortest paths for the
primary, P = p , p ,... p } . Then for each pn ∈ P , a link-disjoint secondary path and a
{ 1 2
K
i
wavelength, sn λ i
, are selected simultaneously ( sn λ does not necessarily have to be the shortest link
disjoint path). Consider the following notation, where a network is represented as a directed graph
G ( N,
J,
W ) , with N being the set of nodes, J the set of links, and W the set of wavelengths. This graph
can be also represented by a set of W virtual graphs, G ( N,
J ) i = 1,..., W
i λ , with each one
corresponding to a specific wavelength. Then using the network state information available at the source
node, the links weights on each graph are adjusted as follows:
⎧0
if λi
on link jis
sharable
λ
⎪
i C ( j)
= ⎨1
if λ on link j is not used
(1)
i
⎪
⎩∞
if j ∈ pn
or λi
is not sharable
where C ( j)
i λ
λ i
is the weight assigned to a link j on G . Note that the source node can determine the
sharability (or non-sharability) of a link by checking its global information database. If the primary path
of the connection in consideration is link-disjoint with the primary paths of all connections protected by
this link, then a wavelength is said to be sharable. A regular shortest path algorithm (e.g. Dijskistra) is
then used to compute the shortest path on each graph. This procedure is repeated for all virtual graphs,
and hence up to W link disjoint paths (or less) with p n can be found. From this, the path with the
minimal total cost is selected as a candidate disjoint path:
( C
Min
i
λi
n
λi
) , where Cn
= ∑
j∈
λ
s i
n
C
λi
( j)
(2)
λ i
After computing all pairs ( p , s ) n = 1,...
K , the pair with the minimal combined cost is selected.
n
n
Here the cost of the primary path is the number of hops along the path, while the cost of the secondary
path is as defined in (2). Once pn is identified, a wavelength is assigned for the path. Note that any
wavelength selection scheme can be used, but for simplicity, we use the First Fit approach. After
selecting the primary/backup path pair and their corresponding wavelengths, the source node triggers its
signaling protocol to simultaneously reserve resources along both paths. Subsequently, after receiving
two positive acknowledgement (ACK) signaling messages, the source starts transmitting data on the
primary path.
4
Note that besides the complexity associated with this algorithm, a large amount of information needs to
be stored and frequently updated to reflect any network-wide changes. These updates can become a
severe bottleneck if connections setup/takedown frequencies are high. Moreover, as network size
increases, the scalability of this protocol becomes another concern.
2.2.1- Distributed Path selection with Local Information (DPLI):
We propose an alternative distributed protocol which exploits the sharability property of reserved
channels yet only requires that local information be maintained at each node. This information is
maintained in a local database to reflect the status of each wavelength on each outgoing link. Namely, if
a wavelength on an outgoing link is reserved for protection, a list of all primary paths of connections
protected by this wavelength is also stored. Each node also maintains up to K shortest-paths and their
corresponding link-disjoint paths.
Upon receiving a connection request, the source node selects a pair of disjoint paths from the arranged
fixed set of routes. This path pair could be the first one in the list or the shortest pair. The source node
sends a Probe message on each route toward the destination to collect available resources on each path.
This message carries the set of free wavelengths along the first path(s) link to be established.
Additionally, the Probe message sent along the backup path also has an additional field that contains the
physical route of the working path of the connection (another one-bit flag is also attached to the
message to indicate the type of the path to be setup). When an intermediate node receives this message,
it determines the set of available wavelengths on its outgoing link (via the local database) and generates
a new wavelength vector to be attached to the Probe message. This message is then forwarded to
intermediate downstream nodes. These nodes determine the sharability of the wavelength by retrieving
the route of the connection’s working path, say p, from the received Probe packet and checking to see if
it is link-disjoint with the routes, p1, p2, etc., of the connections protected by this wavelength.
Meanwhile, upon receiving a Probe message on the primary path, the destination node selects a
wavelength from the attached set of available wavelengths using any wavelength selection scheme.
This node then generates a Reserve message containing the selected wavelength and forwards it back
upstream towards the source to configure intermediate switches. Each intermediate node checks to see
if this wavelength is available and if so, reserves it by cross-connecting its switch and updating its local
database. Otherwise, the intermediate node sends a negative acknowledgement (NACK) message to the
source and a Release message back to the destination to indicate the setup failure. On the other hand,
when receiving a Probe message on the secondary path, a wavelength is selected and a Reserve message
is sent back to the source. Here, the Reserve message only updates the local information database at
each intermediate node without cross-connecting the switch. Upon receiving both Reserve messages, the
source deems the connection request successful and begins to transmit data on the primary path.
5
Otherwise, if at least one NACK message is received, the connection setup fails and any reserved
resources must be released (for further details on this protocol, please refer to [18]). Unlike the previous
protocol, the complexity of this algorithm is minimal since path computation is done off-line. This
improves scalability with network size since only local information is maintained at each node.
III- Analytical model for shared path protection:
3.1- Background:
Various analytical models have been proposed to study the performance of optical networks with fixed
routing, fixed alternate routing, random and first fit wavelength assignment, and with/without
wavelength conversion [7-13].
In [12], the authors derive a model to compute approximate blocking probabilities with and without
wavelength conversion. As they point out, however, this model is inappropriate for sparse networks
because it uses the link independency blocking assumption without considering the dependence between
the acquisitions of wavelengths on successive links. Meanwhile, the authors of [13] present an analysis
that partially accounts for link load dependence. However, here it is assumed that a given wavelength
on a link is used independently of other wavelengths. Hence this simplified model makes good
qualitative predictions of network behavior, but is unable to predict the detailed behavior of simulations
with numerical accuracy.
Another model proposed in [7] uses a reduced load approximation approach with state dependent arrival
rates. The model is shown to be good for smaller networks where multi-link traffic is not appreciable
and is applicable to arbitrary topologies and traffic pattern. It is however computationally intensive, with
the complexity growing exponentially with the number of hops. It also ignores the load correlation
between links due to the wavelength continuity constraint. On the other hand, the authors of [8] propose
a new model using combinatorics-based inclusion-exclusion principles for the analysis of optical
networks with no wavelength conversion and random wavelength assignment. This model improves
upon the approach proposed in [7] in that the complexity is independent of the hop length and scales
only with the capacity of the link as opposed to exponentially. Here, the authors also propose another
model that accounts for wavelength correlation and validate its accuracy even for sparse networks.
Analytical models for FF assignment have been proposed in [9, 10, 11] and use versions of the overflow
traffic model. Here, the analysis is simplified by using the multi-layer representation approach where
each layer corresponds to a wavelength; thus the problem or routing and wavelength assignment is
reduced into routing in a circuit switched networks [16]. The authors of [11] analyze fixed routing in
optical networks with no wavelength conversion and FF assignment using the same technique
mentioned earlier. Here, moment matching techniques are used to model overflow traffic. Similarly,
6
[10] studies fixed alternate routing with FF and assumes Poisson overflow modeling. Additionally,
others have used various other overflow models to analyze network blocking, e.g., such as Binomial
Poisson Pascal (BPP) in [9].
3.2- Blocking Probability in Optical Networks with shared backup paths:
In WDM network with path protection, a connection request is successful if two diversely routed paths
can be found between a source-destination (s-d) pair and commensurate resources (wavelengths) can be
allocated for them. Given the fact that both paths are diversely routed, blocking on one path is
independent from the blocking on the second path. Hence the success probability of one connection is
defined to be:
S d s−
=
prob(
sucesson
primary and sucesson
secondary)
= prob(success on primary)*prob(success on secondary)
= [1-prob(blocking on primary)]*[1-prob(blocking on secondary)].
The blocking for a connection between an s-d pair is computed as follows:
s d
P − s d=1-
S − = 1 ( 1−
p1 )( 1−
p2
) = p1
+ p2
− p1p
2
− (3)
In other words, one needs to compute the blocking on both the primary (p1) and on the secondary (p2)
for each connection so that overall blocking can be approximated. More detailed treatments for network
traffic modeling and path blocking are now considered:
A- Network and traffic assumptions:
In this section we state the assumptions about network characteristics and traffic behaviors, which are
used in our models for calculating path-blocking probability without wavelength converters. Let a
network with N nodes and J links be represented by a directed graph G (N, J), with each link having the
same number of wavelengths (W). Connection call requests arrive according to a Poisson process and
the duration of each call is exponentially distributed with unit mean. Furthermore, let λ be the total
traffic load offered to the network, ar be the offered load to the
7
th
r s-d connection pair,
E = { 1,
2.......
J}
be the set of all links, and W = λ , λ ,......, λ } is the set of all wavelengths.
{ 1 2

For analytical simplicity and tractability considerations, we pre-compute the possible set of primary and
secondary routes between any s-d pair.

primary routes. Here, the pair ( r i , ri
) is the pair of primary and secondary routes between the th
i s-d
pair.
In our approach, the problem of computing path (primary, secondary) blocking on a particular
wavelength is reduced to computing approximate blocking probability in a circuit switched network.
Specifically, we extend the layered-graph approach [19], to develop an approximate analytical model
for the path blocking. By using this layered approach, the RWA problem is reduced to only finding a
wavelength on an end-to-end path between the s-d pair. The search for a wavelength on a path may be
viewed as a search over a sequence of W logical paths, where a logical path is a combination of a
predefined physical path and a particular wavelength. If the logical path under consideration is not
available then the connection request overflows to the next logical path. When we find the two logical
paths under consideration, the connection request is established. Otherwise, the connection is blocked.
Here, we use moment matching techniques, specifically the Equivalent Random Method (ERM) [16] to
model the overflow traffic between different wavelength layers.
Further consider the following variable definitions:

Note that the traffic load on link j from a connection routed on a path r (whether primary or secondary)
can be approximated as follows [16]:

In the case of shared path protection, we develop the following model to compute the link load.
B.1- Property 1:
Let s 1 and s 2 be two secondary paths passing through a link j and let p 1 , p 2 be their corresponding
primary paths. Additionally, let j,

Using this property one can generalize to the case where link j is shared by m secondary paths,
j
{ s 1 , s 2 , …, s m } where their corresponding set of primary paths is P = { p1,
p2

. However,
the difficulty here stems from the fact that some of the corresponding primary paths of this set of
secondary paths (passing through link j) might themselves be link disjoint amongst each other while
10

B.2- Computation of j α
In this section we are interested in computing the aggregated load on link j from a set of m secondary
paths passing by this link. We define F = E −{
j}
, the set of all links in the network except link j.
We further define the array T[N(i)], where each element N(i) is:
N k
k

∀ i∈ F
T[N(i)] is an array of size |F|, where an element at index i represents the subset of all primary paths from
the set , ,..., } p

Next we compute independently the traffic load on link j from each secondary route passing by link j,

Using both equations (8) and (12), one can compute the total traffic load on a link j using equation (6).
Equations (5) and (6) can be solved iteratively to compute the exact values for the link blocking.
On the other hand, given the link blocking on a given wavelength layer, one can compute the primary

IV- Performance evaluation

(17)
(18)
In this section we use simulations results to demonstrate the accuracy of our derived analytical model.
We also compare the performance of the different path selection algorithms, in terms of blocking
probability, sharability gain, and connection average hop count. Here, two network topologies are used:
the 16-node NSF network and 21-node DARPA network. The number of wavelengths per fiber is set to
4 and we consider only one fiber per link. Connection requests arrive at each node according to a
Poisson process with arrival rate λ and the connection holding times have exponential distribution with
unit mean.
First, we show in figure 1 the comparison between the proposed analytical model and simulation results
for dedicated and shared path protection. We solve the model proposed in section II to determine the
end-to-end blocking probability (Eq. 18). First, the path blocking (primary and secondary) on each
wavelength graph is computed using equations (13) and (14), where the link blocking is calculated by
iteratively solving (5) and (6). The total path (primary and secondary) blocking is computed using (17),
and the connection blocking is computed using (3). From this, the overall network blocking is computed
using (18). We use the 16-node NSF network to evaluate the performance of this analytical model.
Although larger networks can also be evaluated, related convergence times for the numerical solutions
become prohibitive. As Figure 1 indicates, our methodology for estimating link loading in shared path
protection is fairly accurate, and matches the simulation results closely.
Next, we compare the performance of the path selection algorithms presented in section III. Overall, our
results confirm that the path selection model has a signif icant impact on network performance. Here,
three plots are shown on the figure (Fig. 2), with the first one representing DPGI and the other two plots
representing DPLI. As mentioned earlier, when using DPLI, the source node maintains an ordered list of
K shortest paths. In DPLI1 (Figure 2), the source node always selects the first pair of paths (which
corresponds to the shortest primary and its shortest link-disjoint backup) in the ordered list. Meanwhile
DPLI2 (Figure 2) selects the shortest pair. The results indicate that DPGI outperforms the other schemes
since it can better exploit the sharability of reserved backup channels by favoring the selection of
protection routes with more reserved sharable channels. However, the drawback of DPGI is the high
complexity involved in the path selection procedure. Moreover, as connections setup/takedown
frequencies increase, excessive updates are required to ensure up-to-date resource usage information.
Clearly, this poses a notable scalability problem and mandates larger databases as network loadings
increases. On the other hand, DPLI1 slightly outperforms DPLI2, which is due to the fact that the
former scheme selects longer protection paths, thus allowing for more channel sharability.

Another key performance comparison is the sharability gain of the path selection algorithms (Figure 3).
This value is defined as the improvement the algorithm yields over conventional dedicated path
protection. As expected, DPGI exhibits better sharability gain, making it more favorable if the network
utilization is the key criterion to be optimized. The figure shows that DPGI improves the sharabilty gain
by 15-25% with respect to the other path selection schemes.

So far, our comparison has only focused on the merits of the DPGI scheme versus other path selection
algorithms. However, although DPGI is more resource-efficient, i.e., since it favors longer backup paths

to maximally exploit sharability, it generally has slower recovery timescales. For example, Figure 6
shows the average path (primary, secondary) hop counts for DPGI, DPLI1 and DPLI2. As expected,
DPGI yields longer backup paths (approximately 8 hops), whereas DPLI2 yields shortest backup paths
(approximately 5.5 hops). Meanwhile, DPLI1 performance is found to lie in between the above two
schemes (approximately 7 hops).

These findings have a major impact on recovery time analysis. As mentioned in section IV, upon
detecting any network element failure, the source (or destination) node of each affected connection is
notified via signaling messages (FNM). Subsequently, the notified node initiates the backup path setup
by sending a Failure Recovery Message (FRM) along the protection route to cross-connect the switches
at intermediate nodes. Meanwhile, if source-based restoration is used, the source has to wait for an ACK
from the destination before it can start transmitting data on the backup route. Therefore, at least one
round trip delay on the backup path is incurred, in addition to the message processing time at each
intermediate node and the time taken to configure each intermediate switch. On the other hand if
destination-based restoration is used, the one-trip delay time is eliminated. Now clearly, recovery times
also depend very much upon the length of the backup path, as well as message processing and switch
configuration times. When the propagation time is a dominant factor (e.g., a 1000-mile fiber span
15
implies 5.36 ms propagation delay), the use of longer backup paths may not be feasible (e.g., a 5000
miles cross-country path will incur 53.64 ms of only round trip propagation delay aside from per-node
message processing time and cross connection times). Hence, short backup path selection is crucial
when the restoration time is a key requirement. Overall, the use of DPGI is unfavorable herein, and
instead schemes such as DPLI2 are more well-suited. For further details on recovery time analysis and
the impact of related signaling procedures, interested readers are referred to [18].
VI- CONCLUSION
The paper addressed the path sele ction problem as a key requirement in the design of efficient mesh
restorable networks. Two path selection algorithms were presented, namely the DPGI that relies on
global information maintained at each node and DPLI, where only local information is necessary. We
showed that path selection algorithms intended to optimize the resource utilization by maximally
exploiting the sharability of reserved channels do not necessarily result in fast restoration. Rather, these
two optimality criteria tend to be conflic ting. Analytical model for evaluating the performance of shared
path protection is presented and its accuracy is validated through numerical comparison with simulation
results.
