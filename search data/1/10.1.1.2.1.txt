Abstract
In this paper, we consider the problem of constructing
hierarchies of nonlinear control systems that preserve
reachability properties, and, in particular, local
accessibility. In this hierarchical framework, showing
local accessibility of the higher level abstracted model
of the nonlinear control system is equivalent to showing
local accessibility of the, more detailed, lower level
model. Hierachies of consistent nonlinear abstractions
can therefore result in significant complexity reduction
in determing the reachability properties of nonlinear
systems.
1 Introduction

One of the main challenges in hierarchical systems is
the extraction of a hierarchy of models at various levels
of abstraction which are compatible with the functionality
and objectives of each layer. In addition, the
use of hierarchies is also useful in the analysis of complex
systems. For example, in order to verify that a
given large scale system satisfies certain properties, one
tries to extract a simpler but qualitatively equivalent
abstracted system. Checking the desired property on
the abstracted system should be equivalent to checking
the property on the original system. Depending on the
property, special quotient systems which preserve the
property of interest are constructed.
As a result, the notions of abstraction or aggregation

refer to grouping the system states into equivalence
classes. Depending on the cardinality of the resulting
quotient space we may have discrete or continuous
 abstractions. With this notion of abstraction, the
abstracted system is defined as the induced quotient
dynamics. Hierarchical abstractions for discrete event
systems have been formally considered in control community
by [2, 9].
In previous work, we have focused on extracting con-

tinuous abstractions from continuous systems. In particular,
in [8] a hierarchical framework for continuous
control systems was conceptualized and formally proposed.
In [6, 7], easily checkable characterizations were
obtained for constructing reachability preserving abstractions
of linear control systems. In this paper, we
extend our hierarchical approach to a significant class
of nonlinear control systems that consists of analytic
control systems on analytic manifolds. In particular,
we address the following problem.

Problem 1.1 Given an analytic control system

 x = f(x; u) x 2 R

n

u 2 R

m

(1)

and an analytic map y = \Phi(x), where \Phi : R

n

\Gamma! R

p

,

p  n, construct a control system

 y = g(y; v) y 2 R

p

v 2 R

k

(2)

which can produce as trajectories all functions of the
form y(t) = \Phi(x(t)), where x(t) is a trajectory of system
(1). Furthermore, characterize analytic maps \Phi

for which (1) is locally accessible (controllable) if and
only if (2) is locally accessible (controllable).

The function \Phi is the quotient map which performs the
state aggregation. System (2) will be referred to as the

abstraction or macromodel of the finer micromodel (1).
In [6, 7], we extended the geometric notion of \Phi-related
vector fields to control systems, which allowed us to
push forward control systems through quotient maps
and obtain well defined control systems describing the
aggregate dynamics. Furthermore, in [6, 7], we were
able to provide constructive formulas for easily generating
linear abstractions of linear control systems.
In this paper, we provide a constructive method for
extracting abstractions for analytic control systems on
analytic manifolds. Our method is the natural nonlinear
generalization of the linear method provided
in [6, 7]. Furthermore, the method is natural in the
sense that it constructs the smallest \Phi-related or abstracted
control system.
We then consider the problem of extracting abstractions
while preserving the property of local accessibility
[5]. We determine conditions on the map \Phi under

which local accessibility of the abstracted system (2)
is equivalent to local accessibility of system (1). Such
conditions ensure that the macromodel is a consistent
abstraction of the micromodel in the sense that reachability
requests from the macromodel are implementable
by the micromodel. In addition, they greatly reduce
the complexity of determining local accessibility properties
of nonlinear control systems, since, rather than
checking controllability of a large scale nonlinear system,
we can construct a sequence of consistent abstractions
and then check the local accessibility of systems
which are much smaller in size.
The structure of this paper is as follows: In Section 2
we revisit some results from [6, 7, 8], whereas in Section
3 we define consistent abstractions. In Section 4 we
restrict these notions to analytic control systems and
provide methods for constructing analytic abstractions
and characterize consistent abstractions. Section 5 applies
our results to various classes of analytic systems.
Due to space restrictions, all proofs are omitted.
2 \Phi-Related Control Systems

We first review some definitions from differential geometry
[1]. Let M be a differentiable manifold and T p M

be the tangent space of M at p 2 M . We denote by

TM =

S

p2M T p M the tangent bundle of M and by

 the canonical projection map  : TM \Gamma! M taking
a tangent vector X p 2 T p M ae TM to the point

p 2 M . Now let M and N be smooth manifolds and
\Phi : M \Gamma! N be a smooth map. Let p 2 M and
let q = \Phi(p) 2 N . We push forward tangent vectors
from T p M to T q N using the induced push forward map
\Phi  : T p M \Gamma! T q N , sometimes also denoted by T \Phi.
A vector field on a manifold M is a smooth map

X : M \Gamma! TM which assigns to each point p of M

a tangent vector in T p M . Let I ` R be an open interval
containing the origin. An integral curve of a
vector field is a smooth curve c : I \Gamma! M that satisfies

c

0

= c  (1) = X ffi c(t) for all t 2 I where c  (1) denotes

c  (

d
dt ).
In this paper, an abstraction or aggregation map is a
map \Phi : M \Gamma! N which we will assume to be a smooth
(or analytic) submersion. Given a vector field X on
manifold M and a smooth map \Phi : M \Gamma! N , not
necessarily a diffeomorphism, the push forward of X

by \Phi  is generally not a well defined vector field on N .
This leads to the concept of \Phi-related vector fields.

Definition 2.1 Let X and Y be vector fields on manifolds
 M and N respectively and \Phi : M \Gamma! N be
a smooth map. Then X and Y are \Phi-related iff

\Phi  ffi X = Y ffi \Phi.
If \Phi is not surjective then X may be \Phi-related to many
vector fields on N . The following well known theorem
gives us a condition on the integral curves of two \Phirelated
vector fields.

Theorem 2.2 ([1]) Let X and Y be vector fields on

M and N respectively and let \Phi : M \Gamma! N be a smooth
map. Then vector fields X and Y are \Phi-related if and
only if for every integral curve c of X, \Phiffic is an integral
curve of Y .

Even though \Phi-relatedness of vector fields is a rather
restrictive condition, this is not the case for control
systems. In [6, 7, 8], Definition 2.1 and Theorem 2.2
were extended to control systems. We briefly review
some of the results of those papers. We first begin
with a global and coordinate-free description of control
systems.

Definition 2.3 ([5]) A control system S = (B; F )

consists of a fiber bundle  : B \Gamma! M called the control
bundle and a smooth map F : B \Gamma! TM which is fiber
preserving, that is 

0

ffi F =  where 

0

: TM \Gamma! M is
the tangent bundle projection. Given a control system

S = (B; F ), the control distribution D of control system

S, is naturally defined pointwise by D(p) = F (

\Gamma1

(p))

for all p 2 M .

Essentially, the base manifold M of the control bundle
is the state space and the fibers 

\Gamma1

(p) can be thought
of as the state dependent control spaces. Given the
state p and the input, the map F selects a tangent
vector from T p M . The notion of trajectories of control
systems is now defined.

Definition 2.4 A smooth curve c : I \Gamma! M is called
a trajectory of the control system S = (B; F ) if there
exists a curve c

B

: I \Gamma! B satisfying

 ffi c

B

= c
c

0

= c  (1) = F ffi c

B
In local (bundle) coordinates, Definition 2.4 simply
says that a trajectory of a control system is a curve

x : I ! M for which there exists a function u : I ! U

satisfying,  x = F (x; u). Note that even though Definition
2.4 assumes c to be smooth, the bundle curve

c

B

is not necessarily smooth. The definition therefore
allows nonsmooth control inputs as long as the projection
  ffi c

B

= c is smooth. We can now define \Phi-related
control systems in a manner similar to Definition 2.1
for vector fields.

Definition 2.5 Let SM = (BM ; FM ) with M :

BM \Gamma! M and SN = (BN ; FN ) with N : BN \Gamma! N

be two control systems. Let \Phi : M \Gamma! N be a smooth
map. Then control systems SM and SN are \Phi-related

iff for every p 2 M

\Phi  ffi FM

In other words, if DM and DN are the control distributions
associated with control systems SM and SN

respectively, then SM and SN are \Phi-related if at every

p 2 M we have \Phi  (DM (p)) ` DN (\Phi(p)). Control system
 SN will be referred to as an abstraction of control
system SM ([6, 7, 8]). Note that many control systems

SN may be \Phi-related to SM as the set of tangent vectors
on N that must be captured, can be generated
using many control parameterizations.
In contrast to the restrictive conditions of Theorem 2.2
for vector fields, the following proposition, shows that
every control or dynamical system is \Phi-related to some
control system for any map \Phi.

Proposition 2.6 Given any control system SM =
(BM ; FM ) and any smooth map \Phi : M \Gamma! N , then
there exists a control system SN = (BN ; FN ) which is

\Phi-related to SM . In particular, every vector field X on

M is \Phi-related to some control system SN .

The following theorem should be thought of as a generalization
of Theorem 2.2 for control systems.

Theorem 2.7 ([6, 7]) Let SN = (BN ; FN ) and SM =
(BM ; FM ) be two control systems and \Phi : M \Gamma! N

be a smooth map. Then SM and SN are \Phi-related if
and only if for every trajectory c M of SM , \Phi ffi c M is a
trajectory of SN .

If \Sigma SM and \Sigma SN denote all trajectories of control systems
 SM and SN respectively, then Theorem 2.7 simply
states that SM and SN are \Phi-related if and only if
\Phi(\Sigma SM ) ` \Sigma SN . The quotient system therefore overapproximates
the abstracted trajectories of the original
system which may result in trajectories that the
abstracted system SN may generate but are infeasible
in the original model SM .
3 Consistent Control Abstractions

In addition to abstracting systems, we are also interested
in propagating properties between the original
and abstracted model. In [6, 7], we focused on controllability
of linear control systems. In this paper, we
focus on various notions of local accessibility for nonlinear
systems.

Definition 3.1 Let S = (B; F ) be a control system on

M . For p 2 M , define Reach(p; S) to be the set of
points q 2 M for which there exists a trajectory c :

I \Gamma! M of S such that for some t 1 ; t 2 2 I we have

c(t 1 ) = p and c(t 2 ) = q.

Definition 3.2 A control system S = (B; F ) is

ffl Locally accessible at p 2 M if Reach(p; S) contains
a non-empty, open set of M .

ffl Symmetrically locally accessible at p 2 M if

Reach(p; S) contains a non-empty, open set of M

which contains the point p.

ffl Locally accessible if it is locally accesible for every

p 2 M .

ffl Symmetrically locally accessible if it is symmetrically
locally accesible for every p 2 M .

ffl Controllable if for all p 2 M , Reach(p; S) = M .
Definition 3.2 is slightly weaker from the standard definitions
of local accessibility found in standard nonlinear
control textbooks such as [3, 5]. In particular,
Definition 3.2 does not constrain the trajectories of the
control system to be within a prespecified neighborhood.
Furthermore, we consider reachable states that
can be reached in any time, rather than up to a certain
bounded time interval. The fact that our notions are
slightly weaker, however, allows us to maintain the following
important results whose proofs are very similar
to the ones found in as [3, 5].
Theorem 3.3 Consider control system SM =
(BM ; FM ) on a manifold M of dimension n, and
the associated control distribution DM defined for all

p 2 M by DM (p) = FM (

\Gamma1

M (p)). Let CM = Lie(DM )

be the accessibility Lie algebra generated by DM . Then

ffl If dim(CM (p)) = n, then control system SM is
locally accessible at p 2 M .

ffl If dim(CM (p)) = n, and DM is symmetric at p,

then control system SM is symmetrically locally
accessible at p 2 M .

ffl If dim(CM (p)) = n for all p 2 M , then control
system SM is locally accessible.

ffl If dim(CM (p)) = n and DM is symmetric for all

p 2 M , then control system SM is symmetrically
locally accessible.

ffl If dim(CM (p)) = n and DM is symmetric for all

p 2 M , and M is a connected manifold, then SM

is controllable.
Theorem 3.3 allows us to check the (symmetric) local
accessibility of a control system by simply checking
the rank of certain distributions. In this paper, however,
we are interested in propagating local accessibility
properties from a control system to its abstraction and
vice versa. Theorem 2.7 allows us to easily propagate
certain properties from the original control system to
its abstractions.

Theorem 3.4 Let control systems SM = (BM ; FM )

and SN = (BN ; FN ) be \Phi-related with respect to some

surjective submersion \Phi : M \Gamma! N . Then for all p 2

M ,

\Phi (Reach(p; SM )) ` Reach(\Phi(p); SN )

Thus, if SM is (symmetrically) locally accessible (at p 2

M) then SN is also (symmetrically) locally accessible
(at \Phi(p) 2 N ). Also, if SM is controllable then SN is
controllable.
Note that Theorem 3.4 is true regardless of the structure
of the map \Phi as long as it is a smooth submersion.
From a hierarchical perspective, the reverse question is
a lot more interesting. In order to arrive at this goal, we
define the notions of implementability and consistency.

Definition 3.5 Let SM = (BM ; FM ) and SN =
(BN ; FN ) be two control systems and \Phi : M \Gamma! N

be a smooth submersion. Then SN is implementable

by SM iff whenever there is a trajectory of SN connecting
 q 1 2 N and q 2 2 N , then there exist p 1 2 \Phi

\Gamma1

(q 1 )

and p 2 2 \Phi

\Gamma1

(q 2 ) and a trajectory of SM connecting p 1

and p 2
Implementability is therefore an existential property.
If one thinks of the map \Phi as a quotient map, then
implementability requires that a reachability request is
implementable by at least one member of the equivalence
class.
Since implementability may depend on the particular
element chosen from the equivalence class \Phi

\Gamma1

(q), it is
resonable to make the controllability request well defined,
by making the request independent of the particular
element chosen from the equivalence class. This
leads to the important notion of consistency.

Definition 3.6 Let SM = (BM ; FM ) be a control system
on M and \Phi : M \Gamma! N a smooth submersion.
Then SM is called consistent with respect to \Phi whenever
the following holds: if there exists a trajectory of

SM connecting p and q, then for all p

0

and for all q

0

such that \Phi(p) = \Phi(p

0

), \Phi(q) = \Phi(q

0

) there exists a
trajectory connecting p

0

to q

0

.
Implementability and consistency allow us to propagate
the properties of (symmetric) local accessibility from
the abstracted system SN to the original system SM .

Proposition 3.7 Consider control systems SM =
(BM ; FM ) and SN = (BN ; FN ) which are \Phi-related

with respect to smooth submersion \Phi : M \Gamma! N . Assume
that SM is an implementation of SN , and SM

is consistent. Then SN is (symmetrically) locally accessible
at q 2 N if and only if SM is (symmetrically)
locally accessible at every point p 2 \Phi

\Gamma1

(q).
In this section we identified the relevant notions for the
study of controllability of \Phi-related control systems.
We also described them for arbitrary systems in terms
of reachable sets. In the following sections, we will illustrate
these notions, and give concrete characterizations
of these concepts for large classes of nonlinear systems
that result in analytic control distributions. Moreover,
we show for such systems how to construct natural \Phirelated
systems with the desirable properties.
4 Consistent Abstractions of Analytic Systems

Let SM = (BM ; FM ) be a control system over a manifold
 M with control distribution DM and let \Phi : M !

N be a surjective submersion. From this point on, we
assume that SM , N and \Phi are all analytic, and that N

is an embedded submanifold of M .
Denote by K the distribution Ker(\Phi  ). Note that K is
analytic and integrable; denote the foliation that integrates
it by K and let k = dim K. The basic idea in the
construction of a control system SN that is \Phi-related
to SM is to first construct a distribution ~

DM on M

which contains DM and is K-invariant, that is, invariant
with respect to vector fields in K. Then \Phi  ( ~

DM )
can be taken to be the control distribution of SN .
If A and B are two C

1

distributions on M , define
a distribution [A; B] by declaring [A; B](p) to be the
subspace of T p M generated by vectors of the form
[X; Y ](p), where X;Y are any two smooth vector fields
in A and B respectively.

Definition 4.1 Let ~

DM be the distribution on M generated
by:

K [ DM [ [K; DM ] [ [K; [K; DM ]] [ \Delta \Delta \Delta :

A graphical illustration of the construction of the distribution

~

DM is shown in Figure 1. Denote by

SM any
control system on M with control distribution

DM .

Proposition 4.2 (a) ~

DM is the smallest K-invariant

distribution containing DM and K.

(b) For all p 0 ; p 1 2 M , if \Phi(p 0 ) = \Phi(p 1 ), then

\Phi 

~

DM (p 0 ) = \Phi 

~

DM (p 1 ):
This allows us to make the following definition.

Definition 4.3 Distribution DN on N defined by

DN (q) = \Phi 

~

DM (p);

for any p 2 \Phi

\Gamma1

(q), is called canonically \Phi-related to

DM . Any control system SN with control distribution

DN is said to be canonically \Phi-related to SM .
By Proposition 4.2, DN is well defined. Furthermore:

Theorem 4.4 DN is the smallest distribution that is

Definition 4.3 and Theorem 4.4 provide us with a constructive
method to generate \Phi-related systems. Furthermore,
the construction is natural since it generates
the smallest such system. We now study how the accessibility
properties of SN are related to SM .

Proposition 4.5 Assume K ae Lie(DM ). Then:
(a) Lie( ~

(d) For all p 2 N : Reach(p; SN ) = Reach(p;
~

SM ) " N .
(e) For all p 2 N : Reach(p; SN ) = Reach(p; SM ) " N:

The following theorem is an immediate consequence of
the preceding result.

Theorem 4.6 Let SN be canonically \Phi-related to SM

and assume (with the notation as above)

Ker(\Phi  ) ae Lie(DM ): (4)

Then:
(a) SN is (symmetrically) locally accessible at q 2 N if
and only if SM is (symmetrically) locally accessible at
every point p 2 \Phi

\Gamma1

(q). Thus SN is (symmetrically)
locally accessible if and only if SM is.
(b) SN is controllable if and only if SM is.
Therefore, as a consequence of the main Theorem 4.6,
if SM is \Phi-related to SN using the canonical construction
described in Definition 4.3 and Theorem 4.4, and,
condition (4) is satisfied, then SM implements SN , and,
in addition, SM is consistent. Therefore, for our canonical
construction only the main condition (4) needs to
be satisfied. In the next section, we apply Theorem 4.6
to various classes of analytic control systems.
5 Classes of Analytic Systems

In this section, we present a few interesting classes of
analytic systems that are captured by Theorem 4.6.
The first class recovers the results for linear systems
that were presented in [6, 7].

5.1 Linear Systems

Consider the linear system
 x = Ax +Bu = Ax +

m

X

i=1

b i u i (5)
where x 2 R

n

and b i are constant input vector fields.
Suppose we constrain our abstraction map to surjective
linear maps y = Cx. For any such map, the construction
of Theorem 4.4 results in the distribution generated
at y = Cx by

CKer(C)

[

CAx

[

CB

[

C[Ker(C); Ax]

for any choice x 2 C

\Gamma1

(y). Since C is surjective, we can
choose x = C

+

y where C

+

= C

T

(CC

T

)

\Gamma1

is the pseudoinverse
of C. Furthermore, CKer(C) is clearly zero,
and higher order Lie brackets are also zero. Therefore
the canonically C-related system for any linear surjective
map y = Cx is
 y = Fy + Gv (6)
where

F = CAC

+

G = [CB CAv 1 : : : CAv r ]
and v 1 ; : : : ; v r spanning Ker(C). In order to
propagate accessibility properties, the linear abstraction
map must satisfy the consistency condition
(4) which is Ker(C) ` Lie(Ax; b 1 ; : : : ; b m ) =

Im[B AB : : : A

n\Gamma1

B] + spanfAxg which can always
be satisfied as long as B 6= 0 since we can always choose
Ker(C) ` Im[B]. In order words, we can always obtain
consistent abstractions as long as there are control
inputs. For any such consistent constructions, local accessibility
of (5) is equivalent to local accessibility of
(5). For linear systems, however, the consistency condition
propagates not only local accessibility but also
controllability [6, 7]

5.2 Nonlinear systems with linear dynamics

Consider the following class of systems
 x = f(x) + g(x)u (7)
 u = Au +Bv

where x 2 R nx

, u 2 R nu

, v 2 R nv

, and f , g are analytic
maps. Such systems frequently arise in mechanical
systems with nonlinear kinematics but linear actuator
dynamics. In studying the local accessibiliy of
the above systems, rather than computing the full scale
accessibility Lie algebra, one would like to decompose
the analysis in order to reduce the complexity. For the
simple projection map \Phi(x; u) = x, then the canonical
constuction of Theorem 4.4 simply results in the
\Phi-related system
 x = f(x) + g(x)u (8)
where u 2 R nu

is now an input. Local accessibility of
(8) is equivalent to the local accessibility of (7) if the
consistency condition (4) is satisfied. A little algebra
reveals that the consistency condition is
Ker(\Phi  ) = spanf



0

I



g ` spanf



terms

B : : : A

nu

B



g (9)
In other words, if the pair (A; B) is controllable, then
we can simply ignore the linear part of the system,
and local accessibility of (8) is equivalent to the local
accessibility of (7).

5.3 Strict feedback Systems

Consider the so-called strict feedback systems used in
backstepping designs (see [4])
 x 1 = f 1 (x 1 ) + g 1 (x 1 )x 2 (10)
 x 2 = f 2 (x 1 ; x 2 ) + g 2 (x 1 ; x 2 )u
where x 1 2 R n1

, x 2 2 R n2

, and the maps f 1 ,f 2 ,g 1 ,g 2

are all analytic. Furthermore, suppose our abstraction
map is the projection \Phi(x 1 ; x 2 ) = x 1 . The canonical
construction can be easily checked to result in the following
abstracted system
 x 1 = f 1 (x 1 ) + g 1 (x 1 )x 2 (11)
where x 2 is now an input. Notice that in this case, the
abstraction of the original system which was affine in
the controls is also affine. If g 2 (x 1 ; x 2 ) is full rank for
all x 1 ,x 2 , then the consistency condition is trivially satisfied
and the the local accessibility of (10) is equivalent
to the local accessibility of (11). If g 2 (x 1 ; x 2 ) is not full
rank for all x 1 ,x 2 , then the consistency condition may
be satisfied using higher order Lie brackets.
6 Conclusions

In this paper,we provided constructive methods for abstracting
analytic control systems with respect to analytic
abstraction maps. Furthermore, we characterized
abstraction maps that result in consistently propagating
the property of local accessibility from one layer
of the hierarchy to another. Our framework was then
applied to various classes of analytic control systems.
There are many directions for further future research.
The results of Sections 4 and 5 will provide hierarchical
controllability algorithms for classes of nonlinear systems.
Obtaining consistent abstractions for nonlinear
systems with respect to stabilizability properties could
be useful in classifying backsteppable systems. Other
properties of interest include trajectory tracking, optimality
and the proper propagation of state and input
constraints.
